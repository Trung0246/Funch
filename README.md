### Features
- Over 250 functions that you can use right now

- Simple to add by copy `<script type="text/javascript" src="funch.js"></script>` or `require("./funch.js");`

- Medium-sized ? (**37.2 KB** compressed using [Babel](https://babeljs.io) -> [Closure Complier](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) -> [JSCompress](https://jscompress.com/))

- Easy to copy and paste any function you like to use without include whole library *(I'm sad :( )*

- No additional objects or classes (except Geometry and Tween obviously for exporting functions)

- No dependencies

### Changelog

- Fixed some bugs

- Added new functions

##### Notes
    
  - If a function depends on another functions, try to use funch.js provided functions if it had, else ask me if that function can be generalized...
    
  - This is my first library. There maybe some bad coding practice in the codebase :(
  
  - I am very inexperienced in Node and modules related stuff, any helps really appreciated :D
  
  - Also I am still don't know how to use git and github properly yet...
