### Features
- Over 130 functions that you can use right now.

- Simple to add by copy `<script type="text/javascript" src="Funch.js"></script>`

- Medium-sized ? (**38.3 KB** compressed using [Babel](https://babeljs.io) -> [Prepack](https://prepack.io) -> [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2))

- Easy to copy and paste any function you liked to use without include whole library *(I'm sad :( )*

- No additional objects or classes

##### Notes
  - When I add new functions, I followed these stuff, sorted by priorities, highest is 1:
  
    1) Features
    2) Performance
    3) Size
    4) Readability
    
  - This is my first library. There maybe some bad coding practice in the codebase :(
  
  - I am very inexperienced in Node and modules related stuff, any helps really appreciated :D
  
  - Also I am still don't know how to use git and github properly yet...
