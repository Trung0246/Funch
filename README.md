### Features
- Over 130 functions that you can use right now

- Simple to add by copy `<script type="text/javascript" src="funch.js"></script>` or `require("funch.js");`

- Medium-sized ? (**32.3 KB** compressed using [Babel](https://babeljs.io) -> [Closure Complier](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) -> [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2))

- Easy to copy and paste any function you liked to use without include whole library *(I'm sad :( )*

- No additional objects or classes (except Geometry and Tween obviously for exporting functions)

- No dependencies

### Changelog

- Fixed some bugs

- Added new functions

##### Notes
  - When I add new functions, I followed these stuff, sorted by priorities, highest is 1:
  
    1) Features
    2) Performance
    3) Size
    4) Readability
    
  - If a function depends on another functions, try to use Funch.js provided functions if it have, else ask me if that function can be generalized...
    
  - This is my first library. There maybe some bad coding practice in the codebase :(
  
  - I am very inexperienced in Node and modules related stuff, any helps really appreciated :D
  
  - Also I am still don't know how to use git and github properly yet...
